# cpp_data_struct_and_algos

Homework 1: implemented a set data structure from scratch

Homework 2: implemented a maze solving algorithm using a stack first and then a queue

Homework 3: implemented various recursive functions

Homework 4: implemented sorting algorithms, template functions, copy constructors/operator overloading, and became familiarized with data structures from STL library


Project 1: implemented various classes for a object oriented game

Project 2: implemented a circular doubly linked list from scratch

Project 3: HAS THE battleship.exe FILE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE FINISHED PROJECT

            implemented a battleship videogame for windows that has a console based GUI
            
            implemented 3 levels of difficulty when playing against the computer: easy, medium, hard, with progressively more sophisticated algorithms for playing battleship
            
Project 4: implemented a symbol table using a hashtable built from a linked list of vectors



All development was done in C++ on Windows 7 using Visual Studio as an IDE.
